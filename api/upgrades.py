"""Upgrade search (2026-09-26): replace library files with a better version.

Agreed with the user 2026-09-26 (whole library, recycle bin, 6K / 15 GB):

Candidates (table `upgrade_candidate`, refreshed by refresh_candidates()):
- 'vr_2d'          -- VR scene whose file is flat (VR check verdict 'mono');
                      target: real stereoscopic VR.
- 'vr_mono'        -- monoscopic 360/180 VR ('vr_mono'); fine to keep, but
                      should become stereoscopic.
- 'vr_low_quality' -- stereo VR below `vr_upgrade_min_mbps` Mbit/s (default 8;
                      the width rule of earlier versions is gone, v0.237.4);
                      target: higher VR resolution, never above the 6K /
                      15 GB limits of indexer_search.vr_candidate_problem().
- 'below_cutoff'   -- non-VR file below the active quality profile's
                      cutoff_resolution (none while no cutoff is set).

Searching (search_one()): the normal search pipeline
(indexer_search.search_and_grab) with a `candidate_filter` that only lets
through candidates that are actually BETTER than the owned file, via the
sidecar's own search source (Prowlarr / direct indexers -- Whisparr can't
search scenes it doesn't track). `dry_run=True` searches and selects but
grabs/writes nothing. A real grab is recorded on the scene's release rows
(created if the scene never was one of ours), with `release.upgrade_of` =
the file to replace.

Replacing (on_upgrade_imported(), called from the import pipeline once the
new file is verified): the old file goes to the recycle bin (reversible for
the recycle-bin retention period) and its old Stash scene entry is removed.
An upgrade that could only be imported UNVERIFIED keeps the old file
('review').

2D protection (flag_2d_import()): when the VR check finds that a file THIS
sidecar just imported is flat/mono, that release is blocklisted for the
scene and the scene becomes an upgrade candidate; the file stays as a
placeholder until the stereo version arrives.
