"""Watching running torrent downloads (v0.231.0).

A newsgroup download either finishes or fails. A torrent can stall, lose its sources, vanish from the client or end in an error state, so
the grab is not fire-and-forget. `run()` looks at every torrent the sidecar started (scenes and movies) at the interval
`torrent_health_minutes` (30), keeps one row per torrent in `torrent_health` and acts on it:

* progress, or download speed -> `ok` (the stall timer starts again);
* paused / stopped by the user -> `stalled` with a note, never switched, no timer; queued / checking by the client -> `ok` with a note;
* the stall time is OBSERVED time: neither the sidecar nor the client runs all the time, so two looks further apart than 2.5 rounds start a
  new window (a client that was off, disconnected from the network, or a sidecar that was not running counts as unknown, not as stalled);
* no progress for `torrent_stall_hours` (1) of observed time -> with real progress (`torrent_real_progress_percent`, 5 %) `stalled`: flagged, never given up;
  without it the download is dead: when the search finds another torrent it is taken and the dead one is removed (with its partial data) and
  blocked by hash; when there is no other one the state is `stuck` and the search is repeated every `torrent_alt_search_hours`;
* qBittorrent state `error` / `missingFiles`, or the torrent is gone from the client -> `error` / `missing`: flagged; the same switch rule as
  for a dead torrent applies when nothing was downloaded;
* a stuck / stalled torrent that moves again is `ok` again, and is still watched.

Nothing is ever deleted unless a replacement was grabbed first (or the user says so). `classify()` is a pure function of the torrent, the
previous row, the time and the settings, so the rules can be tested without a client. Movies are never grabbed by themselves (their
candidates wait in Needs review), so a dead movie download is flagged and the user decides: "Remove" sends the movie back to the wishlist
(torrent removed, blocked by hash) and its normal search proposes another release.
